## Overview

This matching game was created as a requirement for the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree. The game logic includes shuffling the deck randomly with each play, flipping the cards when clicked, and keeping them open if they match.  The game also has a timer, a score out of three stars, a move counter and a modal which pops up when the game is won.

## Getting Started

### Game Play
Click on a card to flip it over. Try to find two matching cards. Continue until you have found all 8 matches using as few moves as you can.

### Browsers
The memory game works best in Chrome, works adequately in Firefox, and doesn't work in Internet Explorer.

### Libraries
This game uses a css animation library called Animate, found [here][https://github.com/daneden/animate.css/].
